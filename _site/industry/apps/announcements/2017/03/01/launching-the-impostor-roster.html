<h1 id="impostors-phonies-and-charlatans---rejoice">Impostors, Phonies and Charlatans - Rejoice!</h1>

<p>When I first started programming, the concept of Impostor Syndrome really hit
home.</p>

<p>You start off feeling like an impostor at everything and slowly the
number of topics you feel like a phony participating in recede, but the pool never drains
completely. There are always <em>some</em> things you think you should be a lot better
at and that you just <em>know</em> everyone ELSE is great at. Everyone but <strong>YOU</strong> of
course…<br />
And indeed that will be true for some things - for everyone. And that’s the
important point. Just about everybody feels this way (citation needed), and
realizing the truth of that fact is all that is necessary to chase away any
significant aspects of the Impostor Syndrome feeling. Briefly,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If everyone is an impostor, then no one is.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="step-up-and-admit-your-shortcomings-here">Step up and admit your shortcomings here:</h2>

<p>Today I’m finally launching <a href="http://impostorroster.com">The Impostor Roster</a>.</p>

<p>I started (and basically finished) this little app in the first few months of
my programming career - which is why it sorta sucks. Like lots of other
projects of mine, I have a backlog of things I want to do before “it’s ready”
to go live. Ocassionally I chip a few things off that backlog, but more often
than not every time I open up the site again  I add <em>more</em> items to fix or
improve before “it’s ready” rather than advance the needle any closer to
production.</p>

<p>This time I’m just sending it out there. It’s terrifically embarrassing in a
number of ways but I’m doing my best to ignore it and hope to fix those things
down the line a piece.  Now is an especially important moment because of a
<a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/834146806594433025">tweet from DHH</a> and a bunch
of industry excitement and articles resulting from it. This atmosphere of
“admit all your professional sins” is <strong>precisely</strong> the reason I started to
build the Impostor Roster. It galls me a bit that I missed the wave on this
one, but I’m hoping to catch some of the run off by getting this out there
today.</p>

<h2 id="an-ugly-deployment">An ugly deployment</h2>

<p>The site was sitting in a free Heroku app that needed to be upgraded to a
modern Cedar stack and I found a bunch of app-breaking bugs in the last hour or
so (amazing that there could be bugs in what’s basically a Rails scaffold,
eh?).<br />
I realize that this application is just begging for defacement and abuse
given that there is no moderation or accounts or flagging of any kind. There is
also no pagination, no nice autocomplete for the category field, a weird system
of ‘number of months of experience’ that doesn’t convert to years, no way to
say ‘Me Too!’ to someone else’s post - forcing you to add you own identical
item, etc. etc. etc. But hey - I’m deploying it anyway.</p>

<p>I hope you like it and use it. Get in touch somewhere or other if you have thoughts.</p>
