# Hello!

This blog is maintained by Vinney Cavallo (me), a person who lives in Providence, RI and does a bunch of things - founding [exnil.io](http://exnil.io) and building great internet products being some of those things. That's mostly what you'll read about on this site.

Techincally, this is a Jekyll blog using my own raw-markdown-appreciation theme I built off the back of hack.css ([go forth and install it!](https://github.com/vcavallo/jekyll-hackcss/))


To check out some of my drawings and non-code thoughts head over to [my personal site](http://vinneycavallo.com/).
