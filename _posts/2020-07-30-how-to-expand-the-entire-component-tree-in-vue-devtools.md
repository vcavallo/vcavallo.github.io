This doesn't seem to be documented anywhere outside of [one vue-devtools PR](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools/pull/265).

**To open up the entire Component Tree in Vue DevTools, hold `alt` and click the arrow. (this may be `option` if you're on a Mac).**

I may have just helped you reclaim many hours of your life.
