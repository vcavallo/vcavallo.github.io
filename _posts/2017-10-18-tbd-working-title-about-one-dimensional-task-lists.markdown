[ TK Drawing of multi-dimensional task list ]

[ TK Drawing of one-dimensional task list ]

[ TK thesis statement ]

[ TK place somewhere] This concept applies to everything from developing the
software product at the heart of a startup to organizing household chores.

A multi-dimensional task list makes it too easy to get the feeling that "We're
holistically getting to all these things a little bit at a time!" from a
cursory glance.

This is a dangerous fallacy. **Time marches along in a single, un-branching
arrow. The `Completed!` moment for a task occupies an instant in time along that arrow - therefore, your capacity to complete tasks is also constrained to a single-file line.**

The order of the single-file line can change, but there's no way in our version
of spacetime for multiple items to move side-by-side through the `Completed!`
gate (multiverse interpretation of quantum physics notwithstanding [TK link
needed]).

drawing ]


There is incredible value in having your visual representation of work to be
done map onto this cold-hard truth of how-things-will-happen. A few examples of
the gains in this approach:

### Benefits of a one-dimensional list:

- For someone completing the tasks (a developer, maybe?), the current focus and
  expectations about what's next will be simpler and create less cognitive
  load.
- For someone with an interest in the tasks' completion (a client, maybe?), an
  unapologetic and honest representation of the future will be immediately
  clear.
- The idea of _Blockers_ is easy to represent. Specifically, _every task is a
  blocker to the one after it!_
- Provides a central and elegant source of truth for what will be done and in
  what order
- Makes communication about priorities, blockers, sub-tasks, etc. trivially
  easy with only one factor to consider: the task order in single-file.

The argument for a one-dimensional task list is best made by the success of the
concept of the Product Backlog in the Agile methodology. [TK link needed]  I
find that Pivotal Tracker [TK link needed] elegantly and effectively
encapsulates this concept in their product. At first glance there are multiple
organizing columns that appear multi-dimensional, but behind the scenes the
tasks are in one big list with "Done" being all the way to one end, "Icebox"
being all the way to the other and the middle split up among "Backlog and
Current Iteration". For me, it's the best of both worlds of *flexible visual information organization* and *adherence to the arrow of time*.

*CUT*: ~The biggest win is that **task order will align with project priority**
- which also means that the output produced by those working off the list will
actually matter relative to the goals at hand.  That sounds deceptively obvious
at first pass - but anyone who has worked on a project with a multi-dimensional
task list will know the drawbacks:

- It's too eas~
