title: remote dev machine webpack-dev-server nginx
---

I spent hours and hours and purpled all google searches I could think of. sometimes after spiraling around I'd come back around to the same google searches but this time I'd have a different working situation as a result of walking through _other_ google search results so I'd try some of these things mixed in with weird combinations of other stuff I'd already tried. A salad of port, host, webserver combinations.  
I think the remote dev vps approach is relatively uncommon and even less common among front end developers who are mostly lurking around javascript and webpack stack overflow answers.

This gist has the instructions: https://gist.github.com/vcavallo/4f11985c4364bc4edfdf56556bff4ccf

The satisfaction of finally getting it working is hugely rewarding.

Another post needed about the Rails + Webpacker solution. here's the gist for that: https://gist.github.com/vcavallo/22cac63d01e3b73a56a92a619c6ff698
