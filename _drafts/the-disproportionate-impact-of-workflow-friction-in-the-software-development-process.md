title: the disproportionate impact of workflow friction in the software development
  process
---

Write about the feeling of "friction" resulting from things like:

- repeating lengthy commands
- having to remember or look up arguments
- uncomfortable keyboards
- having to use the mouse excessively
- clicking on small things
- running through the same steps in apps to "set up" to a point where you can work again
- restarting servers
- etc. (keep adding to this list)

for some reason doing these things is disproportionately stressful and demoralizing. one could say "well looking up that command only takes 4 seconds" and that might be true on the surface, but that 4 seconds (and the lead up to it as well as the lingering feeling afterwards that it could have been avoided) wields more than 4-seconds-worth of drag no productivity. 
this is partially the reason developers like to automate repetition.

The cognitive friction these cause can be disastrous on top of already complex work. its like the brain needs to remain lubricated to do this type of mental work - and these bits of aggravation act like grains of sand in the cogs.

The goal of this post isn't necessarily to arrive at a solution - just to point out this issue and commiserate, as well as document.
