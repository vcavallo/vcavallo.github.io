          Using webpack-dev-server and HMR on a Remote Machine/VPS

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">webpack-dev-server</code>’s livereloading and HMR features on a remote machine (probably over nginx)</p>

<p><strong><a href="#the-solution">The Solution</a></strong> is further down on this page for the impatient <em>(or those who very reasonably don’t care to read about how I got into this situation and how long it took me to solve it!)</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-fluffy-backstory">The Fluffy Backstory</h2>

<p>The joys of livereloading, hot module replacement, instant style updates and their related, rapid relatives have only recently come into focus for me. Now that I’ve seen this dazzling light the idea of toiling away in a dark alley of constantly <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl-R</code>ing a browser window makes me <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="TODO: This will be a post about workflow 'friction'">very miserable</a>. I’ve recently adopted a workflow that involves working on a remote, hosted VPS over <code class="highlighter-rouge">SSH</code> in the terminal. I love almost all the <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="TODO: This will be a post about my dev VPS workflow">things about it</a>, but it briefly pushed me down the dark <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl-R</code> alley. The main reason is simple: You’re no longer hitting a <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:NNNN</code> page anymore - instead you’re going out over the internet.</p>

<p>There are a few issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On-Disk vs In-Memory builds of the site</li>
  <li>Hosts and DNS</li>
  <li>Ports (who uses which ports, who knows this, how to tell the various parties what’s where)</li>
  <li>Firewalls</li>
  <li>Things about HTML headers</li>
  <li>Things about websockets</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent hours and hours and purpled all google searches I could think of. sometimes after spiraling around I’d come back around to older google search results but this time I’d have a different set of configuration combinations as a result of walking through <em>previous</em> google search results so I’d try some of these things mixed in with weird combinations of other stuff I’d already tried.<br />
It was one big shitty salad of port, host, webserver combinations.</p>

<p>By the end, the viable solution is, in summary, this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A publicly-accessible URL (let’s call it <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://devenv.com</code>. and I already checked, it’s taken) with DNS records pointing this domain to the IP of the VPS we’re working off of.</li>
  <li>A static-built version of the files at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dist</code>, served up by a simple nginx server block pointed to the static <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> when navigating to <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://devenv.com</code>.</li>
  <li>webpack-dev-server running, serving an in-memory version of the site over local port <code class="highlighter-rouge">8080</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>another nginx server block <em>using a subdomain such as</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://live-and-hmr.devenv.com</code> which proxies the websocket connection over to the above webpack-dev-server process on <code class="highlighter-rouge">8080</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What I didn’t understand originally was that webpack-dev-server <strong>is a server</strong> (duh) and as a result nginx should not be <em>doing the serving</em> of that resource. It merely needs to step aside and hand off the responsibility to webpack-dev-server. This tripped me up, conceptually, before it clicked and prevented me from reasoning properly enough about the solution in order to arrive at it earlier.</p>

<p>One wouldn’t have to use the two URLs (with and without the subdomain going to the static and dev-server versions) but I found it convenient to be able to work off the HMR dev-server version 90% of the time while keeping the convenience of building the site and flipping over to the static tab for a sort of more <code class="highlighter-rouge">productiony</code> experience.</p>

<p>I thought a bit about why there were so few Stack Overflow posts or blog article about this solution and I arrived at: The remote dev vps approach is relatively uncommon and it may be even less common among front end developers. This is a bit of an assumption and maybe a rude-ish one, but one which is grounded by this bias: Front-end-mostly devs are more likely to be spending their valuable time working on javascript/webpack/gulp/styling workflows, etc. - all of which are noble pursuits and beautiful, but its easy to spend much of your time in that world without having to worry about hosting details, nginx, processes/ports, and the like.<br />
To be clear, this is not a value judgement. Quite the contrary; being a mostly-back-end-developer myself I started off with very little knowledge on the front end challenges listed above and I have a lot of respect for those who know this stuff inside and out.<br />
It has been a long and rewarding journey for me.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>Enough of my yakking! When I finally got the thing working I hastily noted it all down in a GitHub Gist (after doing a lot of wild, expletive-laced celebratory gesturing). The Gist will likely make enough sense to someone well-versed in webpack and its configuring, but I don’t know that its the clearest thing. Let me know if you have questions.</p>

<p>on cobbler concierge right now some tests seem to leak their db data into other tests
(which is maddening because i’m using database cleaner!!) in order to troubleshoot it
i can’t just run the failing tests on their own, because they pass that way… i need
to find a troublesome test and then try a all the other tests in front of it.. i’m
writing a ruby script to do just that.</p>

<p>useful for skipping all remaining tests after a failure - in place of –fail-fast i guess?</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  before :all do
    $continue = true
  end

  around :each do |example|
    if $continue
      $continue = false
      example.run
      $continue = true unless example.exception
    else
      example.skip
    end
  end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>useful for checking state (like db) after each test - i once found some leftover data
even though DatabaseCleaner was supposed to be running.
somehow the above issue was related to <code class="highlighter-rouge">around(:each)</code> usage in tests for some fucky reason
i never figured out.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  around(:each) do |ex|
		if codes.any?
			puts "******* there are partner codesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!@!!!!"
			puts "*** codes: { codes }"
			fail
		elsif codes.include?("tx1")
			puts "*********** wtf there is a tx1 fkfkfkfkkfkfkfkkfkfkkfkfkfkf"
			puts "*** codes: { codes }"
			fail
		end
	end
</code></pre></div></div>

        <p>[ TK Drawing of multi-dimensional task list ]</p>

<p>[ TK Drawing of one-dimensional task list ]</p>

<p>[ TK thesis statement ]</p>

<p>[ TK place somewhere] This concept applies to everything from developing the
software product at the heart of a startup to organizing household chores.</p>

<p>A multi-dimensional task list makes it too easy to get the feeling that “We’re
holistically getting to all these things a little bit at a time!” from a
cursory glance.</p>

<p>This is a dangerous fallacy. <strong>Time marches along in a single, un-branching
arrow. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Completed!</code> moment for a task occupies an instant in time along that arrow - therefore, your capacity to complete tasks is also constrained to a single-file line.</strong></p>

<p>The order of the single-file line can change, but there’s no way in our version
of spacetime for multiple items to move side-by-side through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Completed!</code>
gate (multiverse interpretation of quantum physics notwithstanding [TK link
needed]).</p>

<p>[ TK Drawing of no side-by-side items through the gate next to single-file
drawing ]</p>

<p>There is incredible value in having your visual representation of work to be
done map onto this cold-hard truth of how-things-will-happen. A few examples of
the gains in this approach:</p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-a-one-dimensional-list">Benefits of a one-dimensional list:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>For someone completing the tasks (a developer, maybe?), the current focus and
expectations about what’s next will be simpler and create less cognitive
load.</li>
  <li>For someone with an interest in the tasks’ completion (a client, maybe?), an
unapologetic and honest representation of the future will be immediately
clear.</li>
  <li>The idea of <em>Blockers</em> is easy to represent. Specifically, <em>every task is a
blocker to the one after it!</em></li>
  <li>Provides a central and elegant source of truth for what will be done and in
what order</li>
  <li>Makes communication about priorities, blockers, sub-tasks, etc. trivially
easy with only one factor to consider: the task order in single-file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The argument for a one-dimensional task list is best made by the success of the
concept of the Product Backlog in the Agile methodology. [TK link needed]  I
find that Pivotal Tracker [TK link needed] elegantly and effectively
encapsulates this concept in their product. At first glance there are multiple
organizing columns that appear multi-dimensional, but behind the scenes the
tasks are in one big list with “Done” being all the way to one end, “Icebox”
being all the way to the other and the middle split up among “Backlog and
Current Iteration”. For me, it’s the best of both worlds of <em>flexible visual information organization</em> and <em>adherence to the arrow of time</em>.</p>

<p><em>CUT</em>: ~The biggest win is that <strong>task order will align with project priority</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>which also means that the output produced by those working off the list will
actually matter relative to the goals at hand.  That sounds deceptively obvious
at first pass - but anyone who has worked on a project with a multi-dimensional
task list will know the drawbacks:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s too eas~
<em>(CUT)</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>
